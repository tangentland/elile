# P2 Tasks Summary - Incrementally Deliverable Features

## Overview

This document summarizes all P2 (Medium Priority) tasks. P2 tasks are important features that can be delivered incrementally after core functionality is complete.

**Total P2 Tasks**: 1 task
**Completed**: 0
**Remaining**: 1

## Task Status by Phase

### Phase 6 - Risk Analysis (1 P2 task)
| Task | Name | Status | Dependencies |
|------|------|--------|--------------|
| 6.12 | Risk Dashboard | ⏳ Pending | 6.7-6.11 |
**Status: 0/1 Complete**

## Current Status

Task 6.12 (Risk Dashboard) is the only defined P2 task. It is deferred until after MVP.

## Candidate P2 Tasks

Future P2 tasks may include:
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Additional HRIS integrations beyond Workday
- Extended localization support
- Advanced user preference customization
- Batch processing optimizations
- Archive and cold storage features

## When to Add P2 Tasks

P2 tasks should be created when:
1. MVP (P0 + core P1) is complete
2. Customer feedback identifies medium-priority enhancements
3. Technical debt items need formalization
4. Nice-to-have features are planned for future sprints

## Task Format

When P2 tasks are created, they should follow the standard format:

```markdown
# Task X.Y: Task Name

**Priority**: P2 | **Effort**: X days | **Status**: Not Started
